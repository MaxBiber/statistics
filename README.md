# Applied Exercises from "Introduction to Statistical Learning" (ISLP)

This project consists of solving the applied exercises from the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning", but rather than following the order of questions in the book, I approach them by working with the datasets directly. Each dataset is explored and analyzed using the techniques and methods discussed in the book.

## Features
- Dataset-driven Approach: Instead of solving exercises in the order presented in the book, the exercises are tackled based on the datasets themselves, allowing for more flexibility and exploration.
- Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis: The project involves implementing various statistical learning methods, including regression, classification, and clustering, depending on the nature of each dataset.
- Visualization: Each dataset is visualized using appropriate graphical techniques to help understand the data and make informed decisions during the analysis.
- Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and validation techniques are used to assess the quality of the models built during the analysis.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Each exercise is documented and solved in Jupyter Notebooks, allowing for an interactive approach to exploring the datasets.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pip (for managing Python dependencies)
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab for an enhanced notebook experience)
